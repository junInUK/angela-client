    <h2>NHS</h2>
    <p>The NHS was set up in 1948 to provide everyone in the UK with healthcare based on their needs, and not on their ability to pay. The NHS is respected throughout the world for the standard of care it gives to patients. Although most people think about the NHS as being their local hospital, when you visit your dentist, your GP or even your local pharmacist you could be speaking to someone employed by the NHS.</p>

    <h2>Victims of Domestic Abuse</h2>
    <p>For anyone who feels they are at risk of abuse, it is important to remember that there is help and support available to you, including police response, online support, helplines, refuges and other services. You are not alone. The household isolation instruction as a result of COVID-19 does not apply if you need to leave your home to escape domestic abuse.</p>

    <h2>Ready Scotland</h2>
    <p>Whether it's practical or emotional support, there are lots of ways you can volunteer to help. For some that may be right now in helping to manage the crisis, for others there will be roles in the weeks and months to come. But for many of us, the most helpful thing we can do to support our NHS and our communities is to stay at home to save lives. You can only volunteer to carry out tasks which involve leaving your home, if you are not required to be isolating and are not in any risk categories.</p>
