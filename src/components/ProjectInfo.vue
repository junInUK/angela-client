    <p>COVID-19 has seriously affected human lives and the economy of the World causing untold physical, mental and financial hardship for many. <br>
    The population of the UK and Northern Ireland is self isolating but many people without family and friendsâ€™ are vulnerable and need help from other people.<br>
    Key workers and volunteers across all sectors are exhausted from the many hours they are devoting to help those vulnerable people. <br>
    This App is designed to help the volunteers find those that need help in their area and to assist them in any way they can. <br>
    This is the purpose of the Angela App.</p>
